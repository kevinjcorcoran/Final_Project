# Metric and Links to Datasets Used
Using data from WPRDC, we aimed to find the best nieghborhood in Pittsburgh. Since everyone's definition of "bestness" may be different, we decided to approach this from the angle of raising a family. So, what makes a neighborhood family friendly? As a parent or guardian, one would want to raise their children in an environment that promotes development and learning through a strong school system, safety and quietness through a low crime rate, and social and physical well-being through local entertainment facilities. Ultimately, this all boils down to three main ideas:

# Abstract 
Since each dataset had a varying amount of neighborhoods, we selected the one with the least amount (playground equipments) and used that as our arbitrary list of neighborhoods. If a dataset included neighborhoods not in this list, they were not considered when calculating the lowest value (best) in our scoring system. However, the top ten neighborhoods in each dataset showed varying results, so the final "best" neighborhood was not as we expected since some of the neighborhoods were skipped. According to the final calculations, the top three neighborhoods were **Regent Square**, **New Homestead**, and **Fineview** respectively. By our definition of "bestness", **Regent Square** is the best neighborhood to raise a family in.
